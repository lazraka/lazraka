### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer and a data scientist with an MS in Computer Science and a background in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. I am passionate about cancer research and have directed many of my endeavors towards contributing to this field, most notably working as a Senior Research Technician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and developing a computational model to elucidate the behavior of the p53 tumor suppressor gene for my Master's thesis. I strive to be at the intersection of technology, engineering and medicine to help bring us towards a future with a cure for cancer.
