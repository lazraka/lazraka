### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate from the Samueli Engineering School at UCLA having completed a Master's degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about cancer research and have directed many of my endeavors towards contributing to this field, working as a Senior Research Technician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, developing a 6-compartment model to elucidate the behavior of the p53 tumor suppressor gene for my Master's thesis, and leading a boxing charity event to raise money for Cancer Immunology research. I strive to be at the intersection of medicine, engineering and technology to help bring us towards a future with a cure for cancer.
